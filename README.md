**The Architecture of Collective Coherence — aligning AI, governance, and economics with human meaning.**

This repository contains the **coherosphere whitepaper**:  
a comprehensive socio-technological framework for building decentralized, value-aligned systems.  
It integrates **Proof-of-Contribution**, **resonance metrics**, and **ethical AI**  
into a self-steering ecosystem where technology serves life.

---

## Purpose

The whitepaper defines the **architectural and mathematical foundations** of the coherosphere —  
a new evolutionary sphere where human values, digital systems, and collective intelligence  
operate in resonance rather than fragmentation.

It is both philosophical and technical:  
a **blueprint for decentralized civilization**, where power emerges from contribution,  
not capital or control.

## Contents

- **Abstract & Ethos** — the philosophical foundation of coherence  
- **System Architecture** — Proof-of-Contribution, feedback loops, and governance  
- **Mathematical Model** — formulas for impact, alignment, and resonance decay  
- **Resonance Metric Stack** — measuring coherence across social and technical layers  
- **Symbolic Architecture** — biological metaphors for systemic understanding  
- **Governance & DAO Implementation** — constitutional framework and meta-governance  
- **Appendices** — visual models, comparisons, and critical analyses  

All sections are collaboratively authored and versioned under open governance.

## Core Principles

- **Decentralization** — no center, no hierarchy, no gatekeepers.  
- **Resonance over Control** — coherence replaces command.  
- **Ethical AI** — intelligence in service of life.  
- **Transparency by Design** — open metrics and auditable rules.  
- **Antifragility** — systems that learn and grow through stress.  

The coherosphere redefines governance as resonance —  
a living system that measures and sustains meaning.
