## Glossary of Core Terms
**Alignment (A)** \
A normalized score (0–1) measuring how well a contribution, project, or decision aligns with the values expressed in the coherosphere Manifesto.
High alignment indicates ethical coherence and consistency with shared principles; low alignment reflects value drift or misalignment.

**Alignment Validation**\
The ethical assessment step preceding funding or voting, verifying whether a contribution or proposal coheres with the Manifesto’s principles.
May be conducted algorithmically or through collective deliberation.

**Antifragility** \
A property of systems that grow stronger through stress, disruption, or volatility.
In the coherosphere, antifragility is achieved through adaptive governance, transparent feedback loops, and open learning—turning crises into catalysts for refinement.

**Bitcoin (Hard Base Layer)** \
The economic foundation of the coherosphere: a decentralized, tamper-resistant monetary network serving as a hard, inflation-proof base layer for treasury reserves and transactions.
Bitcoin embodies the system’s principles of transparency, scarcity, and freedom from centralized control.

**Coherence (C)** \
The measurable state of harmony within the coherosphere—how well intentions, actions, and values align across the network.
High coherence indicates strong participation, shared purpose, and mutual trust; low coherence signals fragmentation or disconnection.

**coherosphere** \
A decentralized, living ecosystem where people, technology, and values resonate together.
It functions as both a philosophy (a new evolutionary sphere of meaning) and a technical architecture (a DAO-based infrastructure for collective coherence).
Its purpose is to align artificial intelligence, governance, and money around human flourishing.

**Contribution (E)** \
Any discrete action that adds value to the community—such as creating content, supporting a project, developing software, or mentoring others.
Each contribution is evaluated for Impact and Alignment, then recorded transparently for weighting in governance and reputation systems.

**Contribution Points (CP)** \
A dynamic measure of a member’s cumulative, value-aligned contributions.
Defined mathematically as:

CPᵢ(t) = ∑ⱼ Iᵢⱼ · Aᵢⱼ · e^(−λⱼ·Δtⱼ)

CP represents ethical reputation over time — constantly decaying and renewing to reflect current engagement.

**Cultural Protocols**\
Shared rituals and metaphors derived from the coherosphere’s symbolic architecture (e.g., feed the cells, keep the atmosphere clear).
They translate abstract principles into lived behavior, sustaining coherence through culture rather than enforcement.

**Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** \
The governance structure of the coherosphere.
A programmable, transparent organization that operates through smart contracts on a blockchain, replacing centralized authority with collective intelligence and rule-based automation.

**Decay (Time Decay / Half-Life)** \
A function reducing the influence of older contributions to ensure governance reflects current participation.
Modeled as exponential decay with half-life T:

e^(−λ·Δt), where λ = ln(2)/T

Decay embeds fairness, preventing legacy power accumulation.

**Diversity Index** \
A composite metric tracking variety across demographics, skills, geographies, and perspectives.
Diversity strengthens resilience and coherence by reducing systemic monoculture and fostering creative synergy.

**Gradient of Coherence**\
A conceptual metaphor describing how local actions and signals converge toward higher systemic harmony.
In mathematical terms, it represents the iterative minimization of misalignment — the “learning curve” of civilization-scale coherence.

**Governance Cycle** \
The repeating rhythm of community decision-making: **Initiation → Deliberation → Voting → Execution → Audit.**
Each phase is transparent, rule-based, and feedback-driven, forming the governance heartbeat of the coherosphere.

**Half-Life (T)**\
The period after which a contribution’s influence naturally halves. Half-life defines the temporal fairness constant that keeps governance aligned with current participation.
Typically expressed in months or governance cycles.

**Impact (I)** \
A quantitative assessment of the tangible benefit, scope, or effectiveness of a contribution.
Impact measures what was achieved, while Alignment measures how it was achieved.

**Knowledge Layer (Nervous System)**\
The informational network through which perception, learning, and collective intelligence circulate within the coherosphere.
It includes documentation, educational pathways, and open-source repositories — forming the “nervous system” of the living sphere.

**Local Hub**\
A semi-autonomous community node operating under the coherosphere’s Manifesto. Hubs embody coherence in physical space, executing local projects, hosting deliberations, and synchronizing periodically with the global network.
They represent the “skin” of the coherosphere — local diversity integrated into global resonance.

**Manifesto** \
The ethical and philosophical constitution of the coherosphere—its “DNA.”
It encodes purpose, principles, and values, guiding all actions and decisions.
Stored immutably on-chain, the Manifesto evolves through collective consensus and acts as the ultimate reference for coherence.

**Manifesto Guardians**\
Automated or human review processes that validate whether proposals and projects align with the Manifesto’s ethical code.
Manifesto Guardians serve as resonance filters — protecting coherence without enforcing ideology.

**Meta-Governance** \
The process of governing the governance system itself.
Through meta-governance, parameters such as half-life, weighting exponents, quorum thresholds, and evaluation rubrics are reviewed and revised via high-consensus votes.
It ensures continuous adaptation and integrity of the system.

**Meta-Layer (Meta-Governance Loop)**\
The highest feedback tier where the rules of governance themselves are evaluated and refined.
It ensures that the coherosphere remains adaptive, transparent, and self-correcting across ti

**Normalization (N)** \
A fairness scaling function applied at the moment of contribution entry to prevent exaggerated or biased influence.
Normalization ensures equal treatment across diverse types of contributions by applying transformations such as logarithmic or square-root scaling.

**Phase Logic**\
The structured sequence guiding proposals and decisions: Initiation → Deliberation → Voting → Execution → Audit.
This rhythmic cycle maintains transparency, accountability, and coherence throughout governance processes.

**Proof-of-Contribution (PoC)** \
The foundational governance principle of the coherosphere.
Influence and reputation are earned through verified, value-aligned actions rather than identity, wealth, or seniority.
It replaces “one token, one vote” with “one contribution, one voice”—weighted by ethical and practical resonance.

**Proof-of-Contribution Identity (PoCI)**\
A cryptographic identity layer linking a member’s verified contributions, alignment scores, and voting history.
PoCI prevents Sybil attacks and ensures that influence is inseparable from authentic, value-aligned participation.

**Quadratic Funding** \
A decentralized funding mechanism that rewards broad community support.
Projects with many small backers receive exponentially greater matching funds than those supported by a few large donors.
This method amplifies collective enthusiasm and protects against plutocratic dominance.

**Resilience Layer**\
The symbolic and functional “skin” of the coherosphere — encompassing diversity, antifragility, and ecological stability.
It protects the system against external shocks while enabling exchange and adaptation.
In symbolic architecture, it corresponds to the immune system of the organism.

**Resonance (R)** \
The energetic expression of coherence — how strongly an action vibrates with shared values and community purpose.
Calculated as:

Rᱼ = Iᱼ × Aᱼ × e^(−λᱼ·Δtᱼ)

Resonance bridges ethical intention and measurable impact.

**Resonance Board**\
The interactive dashboard visualizing live coherence metrics — alignment, participation, diversity, and vitality — across all layers of the coherosphere.
It allows members to perceive systemic health in real time and understand how individual actions ripple through the collective field.

**Resonance KPI System** \
A multi-layered measurement framework for monitoring the health of the coherosphere.
It spans from individual alignment to system-wide coherence, visualized through dashboards showing engagement, diversity, contribution, and collective well-being.

**Resonance Metric Stack**\
The hierarchical structure of coherence indicators within the coherosphere — spanning from individual alignment scores to the Systemic Resonance Index (SRI).
It enables transparency across all layers: personal, project, governance, and planetary coherence.

**Resonance Score (Project Level)** \
A performance index combining project impact, supporter diversity, funding resonance, and alignment with the Manifesto.
Used to evaluate initiatives for treasury funding and to track collective vitality.

**Resonance Filters** \
Ethical checkpoints embedded into governance to ensure proposals and projects align with the Manifesto.
They function as value-conscious safeguards—socially deliberated or automated via smart contracts—to prevent incoherent or exploitative actions.

**Resonant Allocation**\
The principle that treasury resources flow toward initiatives demonstrating the highest ethical and participatory resonance — measured through quadratic funding and community support.
Funding follows coherence, not influence.

**Self-Steering** \
The coherosphere’s ability to sense, interpret, and adjust its own state through recursive feedback.
By continuously measuring alignment, engagement, and trust, the system steers toward greater coherence without centralized command.

**Sphere / Atmosphere** \
The holistic outer layer of the coherosphere’s symbolic architecture.
Represents the cultural, ethical, and systemic “weather” of the community—its shared mood, trust level, and global visibility.
Measured via the Systemic Resonance Index (SRI).

**Sublinear Weighting (α)** \
A mathematical constraint on influence:

Wᵢ = (CPᵢ)^α, where 0 < α < 1

It ensures that influence grows with contribution but with diminishing returns — preserving pluralism and equality within meritocracy.

**Systemic Resonance Index (SRI)** \
A global indicator summarizing the health of the entire coherosphere.
It aggregates alignment consistency, member participation, diversity, and project success into a single coherence score.
The SRI allows the system to observe itself as a unified field.

**Transparency by Design** \
A design principle stating that all critical operations—governance, funding, rule evolution—must be publicly verifiable.
Transparency replaces blind trust in authority with provable trust in code and community.

**Transparency Ledger**\
The immutable on-chain record of all decisions, parameters, and rule changes within the coherosphere.
It enables public verification, ensuring that trust arises from transparency rather than authorit

**Voting Weight (W)** \
A participant’s decision-making influence, derived from Contribution Points and sublinear weighting.

Wᵢ = (CPᵢ)^α

Voting Weight ensures that voice follows verified, value-aligned contribution rather than ownership or identity.

**Zap (Feedback Signal)** \
A microtransaction or digital “pulse” sent as gratitude or acknowledgment of value.
Zaps, often transacted via Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, act as micro-rewards for resonance—small but meaningful tokens of appreciation that enrich the community’s emotional economy.

**Summary**\
This glossary defines the operational vocabulary of coherence.
Each term bridges the ethical, systemic, and mathematical dimensions of the coherosphere, ensuring that participants share a common language for understanding its processes.
Together, these definitions form the lexicon of a *new social architecture*—one where intelligence, transparency, and empathy converge in measurable harmony.
